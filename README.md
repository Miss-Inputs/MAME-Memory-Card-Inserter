# MAME-Memory-Card-Inserter

A MAME plugin that automatically inserts a memory card into Neo Geo games (AES or arcade machines) for you. Needs 0.227 because of the rewrite, for older versions (will probably need at least MAME 0.212) use version 0.01.

To use this, clone/download the repo and put the folder in your pluginspath, put "memory_card_inserter.ini" in homepath and edit that to have a line like this:  
`memory_card_path=/path/to/where/you/want/your/memory/cards`  
Spaces around = should probably work.  

Might not work on Windows, might not work with other weird system configurations, who knows.
